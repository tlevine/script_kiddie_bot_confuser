Script kiddies crawl your site looking for security vulnerabilities.
Your site is secure because you're awesome, but you still find these
script kiddies annoying.

The script kiddy bot confuser responds in confusing ways to the requests
of these bots.

Since the bots are likely running in threads rather than event loops,
responding slowly will probably slow down their crawls. The default
behavior of the script kiddy bot confuser is not to respond at all
to the bots.

If you want to ban the users, you need to install django-ban and ipcalc
and then make some change in the settings file.
